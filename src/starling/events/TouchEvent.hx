/** A TouchEvent is triggered either by touch or mouse input.  
 *
 *  <p>In Starling, both touch events and mouse events are handled through the same class:
 *  TouchEvent. To process user input from a touch screen or the mouse, you have to register
 *  an event listener for events of the type <code>TouchEvent.TOUCH</code>. This is the only
 *  event type you need to handle; the long list of mouse event types as they are used in
 *  conventional Flash are mapped to so-called "TouchPhases" instead.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The difference between mouse input and touch input is that</p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>only one mouse cursor can be present at a given moment and</li>
 *    <li>only the mouse can "hover" over an object without a pressed button.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <strong>Which objects receive touch events?</strong>
 *
 *  <p>In Starling, any display object receives touch events, as long as the
 *  <code>touchable</code> property of the object and its parents is enabled. There
 *  is no "InteractiveObject" class in Starling.</p>
 *
 *  <strong>How to work with individual touches</strong>
 *
 *  <p>The event contains a list of all touches that are currently present. Each individual
 *  touch is stored in an object of type "Touch". Since you are normally only interested in
 *  the touches that occurred on top of certain objects, you can query the event for touches
 *  with a specific target:</p>
 *
 *  <code>var touches:Vector.&lt;Touch&gt; = touchEvent.getTouches(this);</code>
 *
 *  <p>This will return all touches of "this" or one of its children. When you are not using
 *  multitouch, you can also access the touch object directly, like this:</p>
 *
 *  <code>var touch:Touch = touchEvent.getTouch(this);</code>
 *
 *  @see Touch
 *  @see TouchPhase
